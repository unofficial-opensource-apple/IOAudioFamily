\b0 	-	The following drivers are set up as simple templates which can be used as a starting point for new audio drivers.  They do not work as is.\

\cf0 -	Simple skeleton audio driver\
-	Does not implement any IOAudioEngine code (or timers to simulate) so any attempt to play audio will result in the audio app hanging\
-	Implements left and right input and output, left and right volume controls and input and output master mute controls\
-	Matches on an always present registry entry (IOResources) to allow the driver to be loaded and instantiated\
-	Can be used as a starting point for an audio driver\
-	Comments have been placed indicating places where driver-specific tasks should be performed\
-	Additionally, device matching information in the IOKitPersonalities bundle entry need to be changed to ensure it matches against the proper entry for the hardware\

\i0\b0 \cf0 -	Skeleton PCI audio driver \
-	Adds PCI config register mapping to driver init code\
-	Adds example for creating an IOInterruptEventSource to show how to get interrupts into the driver\
-	Adds PCI device mapping criteria in IOKitPersonalities bundle entry\
-	Can be used as a starting point for a PCI audio driver\
-	PCI device matching information should be changed to match the specific PCI card\
